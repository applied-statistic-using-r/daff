*R* provides a good environment for reproducible data analysis: Using R scripts data can be processed, analyzed and 
reported upon without manual intervention. However often data analysis processes are more complex: parts of it may be 
out of your control: the input data to your analysis is updated over and over again, or there is a _black box_ or manual 
editing step in data process flow. R pacakge `daff` tracks changes in data.frames by making a data diff [@fitzpatrick].
A data diff does not only document data changes, but can also be used to _patch_ (a new version of) input data, thereby
making the processing and analysis reproducible from begin to end.
